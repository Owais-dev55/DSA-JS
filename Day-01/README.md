Type coersion : 
Type coercion is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. In programming languages like JavaScript, type coercion can happen implicitly (automatically by the language) or explicitly (manually by the programmer).
(Jab hum ek type ko dusre type me convert karte hain to use type coercion kehte hain automatically ya manually.)

hosting :
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase before the code is executed. This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code.
(Hosting ek JavaScript mechanism hai jisme variable aur function declarations ko unke containing scope ke top par le jaya jata hai compilation phase ke dauran code execute hone se pehle. Iska matlab hai ki aap variables aur functions ko unke declare hone se pehle use kar sakte hain.)

Type Casting :
Type casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another explicitly by the programmer. This is done using specific functions or methods provided by the programming language.
(Type casting ek process hai jisme ek value ko ek data type se dusre data type me explicitly programmer dwara convert kiya jata hai. Yeh specific functions ya methods ka use karke kiya jata hai jo programming language provide karti hai.)
